               <p>Hey! Thanks for looking at my website! I know its not the best, but as time goes on, hopefully it will slowly improve! 
                    Well since you're here, here are some things about me. I am currently a fourth year RIT student studying to get my
                    Bachelors in Computer Engineering. Its been a rough journey but I'm sure I will figure things out, time moves on with or without me!
                    Interestingly, I always hated programming. I didn't like it when I was in highschool, hated it in college, and here I am.
                    As much as I wanted to change majors, it was something I stuck with to see if I could do it. I am slowly coming to terms
                    that Computer Engineering isn't THAT bad, right?
                </p>
                <p> I LOVE volleyball. I've played since I was in highschool at Gates Chili High School. I joined the HS team
                    and fell in LOVE with the game. There is just something about volleyball that its just THAT amazing. Some people have it other things,
                    but for me, its gotta be volleyball. Unfortunately in Fall 2019 I completely tore my ACL and significantly tore my meniscus in my left
                    knee. Ouch! I'm looking to get some surgery done and get back on the field! Did you know I played the middle positon? I used to be able to
                    jump really high! Nothing beats spiking a volleyball.
                </p>
               <p> After volleyball, probably my most interesting fact is my girlfriend. I am in a long distance relationship with my girlfriend Bernie.
                   I currently live in Rochester and she lives in Boston. Most of the internships I apply to are located near/at Boston for a reason! I met her
                   online via video games. She treats me so well. I am pushing my best through college and applying to everything in Massachusetts so I can 
                   be closer to her. Long distance relationships suck!
               </p>
               <h2 class="section__subtitle section__subtitle--about">Tech Stuff!</h2>
               <p>Why Computer Engineering? I'll be honest, I took an online quiz and it narrowed me down to Electrical Engineeing and Computer Engineer. 
                   I thought Computer Engineering sounds way cooler so thats what I ended up picking. The reason why I ultimately went into Computer Engineering
                   besides the Quiz of Destiny, was becauuse I really enjoyed fixing problems and helping others. I am also highly fascinated by technologyical advances. 
                   With technology being the future, engineering was something I HAD to try.
               </p>
               <p>There are so many things left I wanna try and learn. Some things I want to look at are autonomy, machine learning, AI, the cool stuff. One day I hope 
                   everything in my house is autonomous. Hopefully my mind keeps on the same track and I get to try some of this stuff in the future!
               </p>
